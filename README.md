# SVD-and-Custom-Word-Vector-
Here I am using the Matrix Factorization technique to form Custom word vector  . For implementation of all the code I have used the SKlearn Library.    step 1 Select the top 2k words from essay text and project_title (concatinate essay text with project title and then find the top 2k words) based on their idf_ values step 2 Compute the co-occurrence matrix with these 2k words, with window size=5 (ref)  step 3 Use TruncatedSVD on calculated co-occurance matrix and reduce its dimensions, choose the number of components (n_components) using elbow method The shape of the matrix after TruncatedSVD will be 2000*n, i.e. each row represents a vector form of the corresponding word. Vectorize the essay text and project titles using these word vectors. (while vectorizing, do ignore all the words which are not in top 2k words) step 4 Concatenate these truncatedSVD matrix, with the matrix with features school_state : categorical data clean_categories : categorical data clean_subcategories : categorical data project_grade_category :categorical data teacher_prefix : categorical data quantity : numerical data teacher_number_of_previously_posted_projects : numerical data price : numerical data sentiment score's of each of the essay : numerical data number of words in the title : numerical data number of words in the combine essays : numerical data word vectors calculated in step 3 : numerical data step 5: Apply GBDT on matrix that was formed in step 4 of this assignment, DO REFER THIS BLOG: XGBOOST DMATRIX step 6:Hyper parameter tuning (Consider any two hyper parameters) Find the best hyper parameter which will give the maximum AUC value Find the best hyper paramter using k-fold cross validation or simple cross validation data Use gridsearch cv or randomsearch cv or you can also write your own for loops to do this task of hyperparameter tuning
